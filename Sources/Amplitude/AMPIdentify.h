/**
 `AMPIdentify` objects are a wrapper for user property operations, which get passed to the `identify` method to send to Amplitude servers.

 **Note:** if a user property is used in multiple operations on the same Identify object, only the first operation will be saved, and the rest will be ignored.

 Each method adds a user property operation to the Identify object, and returns the same Identify object, allowing you to chain multiple method calls together.

 Here is an example of how to use `AMPIdentify` to send user property operations:

    AMPIdentify *identify = [[AMPIdentify identify] add:@"karma" value:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1]];
    [[identify set:@"colors" value:@[@"rose", @"gold"]] append:@"ab-tests" value:@"campaign_a"];
    [[Amplitude instance] identify:identify];
