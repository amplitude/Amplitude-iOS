## Unreleased

* Add ability to set custom deviceId.
* Add support for user property operations (set, setOnce, add, unset).
* Add ability to go offline (disable sending logged events to server).

## 3.1.1 (October 8, 2015)

* Switch to using FMDB/standard.

## 3.1.0 (October 5, 2015)

* Migrate events data to Sqlite database.
* Fix bug where end session event was not being sent upon app reopen.
* Fix bug in database path.

## 3.0.1 (September 21, 2015)

* Fix uploadEventsWithDelay bug not triggering uploadEvents.
* Fix crash when dictionaries are deallocated during logEvent.

## 3.0.0 (August 20, 2015)

* Simplified session tracking. minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis default changed to 5 minutes. Removed sessionTimeoutMillis. No longer send start/end session events by default.
* Can now clear userId by setting to nil (subsequent logged events will be anonymous).

## 2.5.1 (June 12, 2015)

* Fix crash when array or dictionary is modified during JSON serialization.

## 2.5.0 (May 29, 2015)

* Static methods are now deprecated. Use the [Amplitude instance] singleton instead.
* Enable configuration of eventUploadThreshold, eventMaxCount,
  eventUploadMaxBatchSize, eventUploadPeriodSeconds, minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis,
  and sessionTimeoutMillis.

## 2.4.0 (April 7, 2015)

* Expose the startSession method publicly. Can be used to start a session for a user
  interaction that happens while the app is in the background, for example,
  changing tracks on background audio.
* No longer starts a session if the app is in the background when the SDK is
  initialized. Prevents logging of silent push notifications from starting
  a session and counting a user visit. This changes the previous default
  behavior. To maintain the previous behavior, use
  initializeApiKey:apiKey:userId:startSession and set startSession to true.
