## 3.8.1 (June 14, 2016)

* Fix bug where subsequent calls to `initializeApiKey` after the first were not being ignored.

* Can now clear userId by setting to nil (subsequent logged events will be anonymous).

## 2.5.1 (June 12, 2015)

  eventUploadMaxBatchSize, eventUploadPeriodSeconds, minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis,
  and sessionTimeoutMillis.

## 2.4.0 (April 7, 2015)

  interaction that happens while the app is in the background, for example,
  changing tracks on background audio.
* No longer starts a session if the app is in the background when the SDK is
  initialized. Prevents logging of silent push notifications from starting
  a session and counting a user visit. This changes the previous default
  behavior. To maintain the previous behavior, use
  initializeApiKey:apiKey:userId:startSession and set startSession to true.
