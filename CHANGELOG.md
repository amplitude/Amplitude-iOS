## Unreleased

## 4.2.0 (April 19, 2018)

* Added a `setUserId` method with optional boolean argument `startNewSession`, which when `YES` starts a new session after changing the userId.

## 4.1.0 (February 27, 2018)
* Add option to disable IDFA tracking. To disable IDFA tracking call `[[Amplitude instance] disableIdfaTracking];` before initializing with your API key.

## 4.0.4 (October 23, 2017)

* Fix bug where events in the initial session for brand new users have a session id of -1 (introduced in v4.0.2).

## 4.0.3 (October 16, 2017)

* Fix unknown carrier caching. This fixes "Could not successfully update network info during initialization" warnings when logging events on devices without SIM cards.

## 4.0.2 (October 13, 2017)

* Ensure the foreground checker in `initializeApiKey` runs on the main thread. This fixes the "UI API called on a background thread" warning.
* Removing unnecessary try / catch when looking up device carrier.

## 4.0.1 (September 18, 2017)

* Lowering minimum required iOS version down to 7.0.

## 4.0.0 (September 18, 2017)

* Minimum required iOS version is now 9.0

* Migrate setup instructions and SDK documentation in the README file to Zendesk articles.

## 3.14.1 (March 14, 2017)

* Catch exceptions when looking up device carrier.
* Fix build warnings caused by certificate files in the Podfile. Thanks to @benasher44 for the PR.
* Fix warnings for missing new line at end of files. Thanks to @teanet for reporting.
* Fix linker warnings when using Amplitude framework in an extension target. Thanks to @r-peck for the PR.

## 3.14.0 (February 2, 2017)

* Add support for enabling SSL-pinning via Cocoapods. Thanks to @aaronwasserman for the PR. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/amplitude-ios#ssl-pinning) for more information.

## 3.13.0 (January 30, 2017)

* Add support for tvOS. Thanks to @gabek for the original PR. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS#tvos) for more information.
* Bump iOS minimum deployment target to 6.0.
* Update device list. Thanks to @subbotkin for the PR.

## 3.12.1 (December 15, 2016)

* Fix bug where `regenerateDeviceId` was not being run on background thread.
* `[AMPDeviceInfo generateUUID]` should be a static method.

## 3.12.0 (December 5, 2016)

* Add helper method to regenerate a new random deviceId. This can be used in conjunction with `setUserId:nil` to anonymize a user after they log out. Note this is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS#logging-out-and-anonymous-users) for more information.

## 3.11.1 (November 7, 2016)

* Allow `logEvent` with a custom long long timestamp (milliseconds since epoch). See [iOS documentation](https://rawgit.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS/v3.11.1/documentation/html/Classes/Amplitude.html#//api/name/logEvent:withEventProperties:withGroups:withLongLongTimestamp:outOfSession:) for more details.

## 3.11.0 (November 7, 2016)

* Allow `logEvent` with a custom timestamp (milliseconds since epoch). If the timestamp value is `nil`, then the event is timestamped with the current time. If setting a custom timestamp, you should use `[NSNumber numberWithLongLong:milliseconds]`. See [iOS documentation](https://rawgit.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS/master/documentation/html/Classes/Amplitude.html#//api/name/logEvent:withEventProperties:withGroups:withTimestamp:outOfSession:) for more details.

## 3.10.1 (October 31, 2016)

* Enable "Weak References in Manual Retain Release" to fix build errors in Xcode 7.3 and up.

## 3.10.0 (October 26, 2016)

* Add ability to log identify events outOfSession, this is useful for updating user properties without triggering session-handling logic. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS#tracking-sessions) for more information.

## 3.9.0 (October 7, 2016)

* Switch to unarchiving unsent events archive file with `[NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithFile]` to iOS 9's `[NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData]`. Note: this only affects you if you are *upgrading from an SDK version older than v3.1.0 straight to v3.9.0 or newer*. Users who have not updated to iOS 9.0 or newer will lose any unsent events stored on their devices. This also removes all Objective-C Exceptions (@try/@catch) from the SDK, removing the need to toggle `Enable Objective-C Exceptions` in Xcode.
* Block event property and user property dictionaries that have more than 1000 items. This is to block properties that are set unintentionally (for example in a loop). A single call to `logEvent` should not have more than 1000 event properties. Similarly a single call to `setUserProperties` should not have more than 1000 user properties.

## 3.8.5 (August 29, 2016)

* Fix crash by handling NULL events saved to and fetched from the database.

## 3.8.4 Re-release (August 19, 2016)

* Added support for integration via Carthage. Thanks to @mpurland for the original PR. Thanks to @lexrus for follow up PR to fix framework naming.
* Cleaned up warnings for expression result unused.
* Note if you installed 3.8.4 on August 18, just rerun `pod install` or `carthage update` to pull in the new changes. The re-release was to fix the Carthage framework naming.

## 3.8.3 (July 18, 2016)

* Fix overflow bug for long long values saved to Sqlite DB on 32-bit devices.

## 3.8.2 (July 11, 2016)

* `productId` is no longer a required field for `Revenue` logged via `logRevenueV2`.
* Fix bug where revenue receipt was being truncated if it was too long (exceeded 1024 characters);

## 3.8.1 (June 14, 2016)

* Allow ability to silence error messages. Note error messages are printed by default. To disable error logging, change `AMPLITUDE_LOG_ERRORS` from `1` to `0` in `Amplitude.m`.

## 3.8.0 (June 13, 2016)

* Add support for iOS Extensions. See the [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/amplitude-ios#ios-extensions) for instructions, or check out our [iOS-Extension-Demo](https://github.com/amplitude/iOS-Extension-Demo). Credit to @andyyc for the original PR.
* Fix bug where subsequent calls to `initializeApiKey` after the first were not being ignored.
* Guard debug log statements with a debug flag (disabled by default). To enable debug logging, change `AMPLITUDE_DEBUG` from `0` to `1` at the top of the Objective-C file you wish to examine.

## 3.7.1 (June 10, 2016)

* Add documentation for SDK functions. You can take a look [here](https://rawgit.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS/master/documentation/html/index.html). A link has also been added to the Readme.
* Updated device mapping with iPhone SE, iPad Mini 4, and iPad Pro.
* Fix crash during upgradePrefs in the init method. This bug affected app users who were upgrading from an old version of an app using Amplitude iOS v2.1.1 or earlier straight to a version of the app using Amplitude iOS v3.6.0 or later.

## 3.7.0 (April 20, 2016)

* Add helper method `getSessionId` to expose the current sessionId value.
* Add support for setting groups for users and events. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS#setting-groups) for more information.
* Add logRevenueV2 and new Revenue class to support logging revenue events with properties, and revenue type. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS#tracking-revenue) for more info.

## 3.6.0 (March 28, 2016)

* Add support for prepend user property operation.
* Fix support for 32-bit devices. Switch to using sqlite3.0, and cast return values from sqlite3.
* Add support for logging events to multiple Amplitude apps. See [Readme](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS#tracking-events-to-multiple-amplitude-apps) for details.

  eventUploadMaxBatchSize, eventUploadPeriodSeconds, minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis,

  interaction that happens while the app is in the background, for example,
  changing tracks on background audio.
* No longer starts a session if the app is in the background when the SDK is
  initialized. Prevents logging of silent push notifications from starting
  a session and counting a user visit. This changes the previous default
  behavior. To maintain the previous behavior, use
  initializeApiKey:apiKey:userId:startSession and set startSession to true.
